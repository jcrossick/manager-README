# manager-README - A readme about me

What's a readme? Why have one? More here! https://managerreadme.com/

## Let's talk :-)

So, let's start with the obvious stuff. I am busy! But this is my problem, not yours - you should never feel like my inability to manage my time should impact on you. The best way to get time with me is to **put time in my diary** (please try not to overlap with a pre-existing commitments). I will always prioritise one-on-one time with people who book it in with me.

## Quickstart guide

**Rule 1: No surprises**

That means:
* I value transparency, and I will always strive to never surprise you!
* That goes for client engagements too - I will always try to make sure that everyone knows what is going to happen next.
* The nature of our work means that situations sometimes change quickly. If you're involved I will try to keep you up to date.
* If you want to have a chat about something in particular, then that's cool - but you're more likely to get more out of it if you give me a heads up on the topic first.
* If there's something on your mind then please tell me.
* If you want to give me feedback then give me a heads up first.
* If I feel you are under-performing in any areas I will strive to talk to you about it _before_ it becomes a problem.

## My role

I'm a squad lead at AND Digital. As a squad lead, I have three jobs:
1. I'm a line manager for my squad, which means I look after their personal and career development at AND
2. I lead a client engagement, which means I look after the client relationship and the team working on a client
3. I am part of the club ops team for Club Turing, which means I help keep the club running smoothly, inputting into things like our performance and progression process.

## My leadership style

My preferred style is to work with teams with large amounts of autonomy and to have a strong coaching element to my role. I always strive to make teams self-organising and take collective responsibility. If you ask me "what should I do", I'll take that as a starting point for a conversation.

Sometimes when there's a lot of pressure I'll move to a more command-and-control style. I don't see this as a positive leadership style, although it can be useful for getting team out of a tight spot, so this should be the exception rather than the rule and should never be for extended periods. If you feel like I'm doing this, please raise it with me. You may be rude about it if you wish!

One of my growth areas that I'm still working on is effective delegating. If you see something that I'm doing that you would like to do, the chances are I'll be happy to let you take it on!

## My values

I value...
* Intellectual curiosity
* Reliability and conscientiousness
* Hard work and rigour
* Collaboration and constructive challenge
* Kindness and generosity

## About feedback

If you want generic/wide-ranging feedback, it'll be more fully formed if you give me a couple of days to mull it over. I generally make notes, discuss it face to face, and then will give you my notes afterwards. If you'd like it in a different form, please let me know.

Fun fact: Squad leads don't get nearly as much feedback as they want or need. If you give me feedback, it will be gratefully received.

## Getting the most out of me

I work best in one-on-one or small group situations

I love fast-paced collaborative conversations, especially around a whiteboard :-)

## My personality quirks

I have some pretty strong perfectionist tendencies. If you think that sounds like a cop-out, you don't know how paralysing and stressful it can be to hold yourself to unobtainably high levels.

My job involves a lot of context switching, a lot of meetings and keeping an eye on many things at once. This can be a stress trigger for me.

I am not always the best at reading sub-text. If your communication protocols rely on body-language, reading between the lines or noticing social interactions, you should expect high packet loss.
